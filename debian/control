Description: C-based/Cached/Core Computer Vision Library
 ccv end up implementing a handful state-of-art algorithms.
 It includes a very fast detection algorithm for rigid object (face, etc..),
 an accurate object detection algorithm for somewhat difficult object
 (pedestrian, cat, etc..), a state-of-art text detection algorithm,
 and the long-standing feature point detection algorithm.
